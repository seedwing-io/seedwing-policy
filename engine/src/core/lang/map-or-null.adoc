Parameterized patterns that maps a function over the values and returns the transformed values as output.

Values that are not matching will be transformed to `null` values, which is different from the semantics of the `lang::map` pattern.

For lists, the function will apply the parameterized function to each element in the list.

For other values, the input will be passed as is.
