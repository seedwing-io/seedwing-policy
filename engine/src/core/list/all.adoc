Parameterized pattern that ensures all members of an input list match the pattern.

An empty input list *does* match this pattern.

For instance, this pattern:

[source]
----
pattern only-numbers = list::all<integer>
----

would match

[source,json]
----
[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
----

and would also match

[source,json]
----
[ ]
----

but would not match

[source,json]
----
[ 1, 2, 3, "bob" ]
----
