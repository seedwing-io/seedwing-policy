Parameterized pattern that ensures any member of an input list match the pattern.

An empty input list does *not* match.

For instance:

[source]
----
pattern contains-bob = list::any<"Bob">
----

Would match

[source,json]
----
[ "Bob", "Jim" ]
----

but would not match

[source,json]
----
[ "Robert", 42 ]
----
