Lookup vulnerability information for a package URL (pURL) in Open Source Vulnerability (OSV) and return OpenVex document with vulnerability information.

You can combine this with other patterns to check if a given package has any known vulnerabilities:

```
pattern not-vulnerable = uri::Purl(openvex::FromPurl(openvex::patterns::not-affected))
```
