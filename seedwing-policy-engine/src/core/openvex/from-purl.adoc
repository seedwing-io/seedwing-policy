Lookup vulnerability information for a package URL (pURL) in Open Source Vulnerability (OSV) and return OpenVex document with vulnerability information.

You can combine this with other patterns to check if a given package has any known vulnerabilities:

```
pattern not-vulnerable = uri::purl(openvex::from-purl(openvex::not-affected))
```
