Get the tail section of a list.

For instance, this pattern:

[source,subs=normal]
----
pattern split = list::Tail<2>({
  tail: [4, 5],
  main: [1, 2, 3],
})
----

Would match the input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

The logic is greedy, it tries to fill the `tail` section first:

[source,subs=normal]
----
pattern split = list::Tail<3>({
  tail: [1, 2],
  main: [],
})
----

Would match the input: `[1, 2]`

It is also possible to just get one item, omitting the binding:

[source,subs=normal]
----
pattern split = list::Tail({
  tail: [5],
  main: [1, 2, 3, 4],
})
----

Would match the input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
