Get the head section of a list.

For instance, this pattern:

[source,subs=normal]
----
pattern split = list::Head<2>({
  head: [1, 2],
  main: [3, 4, 5],
})
----

Would match the input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

The logic is greedy, it tries to fill the `head` section first:

[source,subs=normal]
----
pattern split = list::Head<3>({
  head: [1, 2],
  main: [],
})
----

Would match the input: `[1, 2]`

It is also possible to just get one item, omitting the binding:

[source,subs=normal]
----
pattern split = list::Head({
  head: [1],
  main: [2, 3, 4, 5],
})
----

Would match the input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
