Parameterized pattern that ensures all members of an input list match the pattern.

An empty input list *does* match this pattern.

For instance, this pattern:

```
pattern only-numbers = list::All<integer>
```

would match

```json
[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
```

and would also match

```json
[ ]
```

but would not match

```json
[ 1, 2, 3, "bob" ]
```
