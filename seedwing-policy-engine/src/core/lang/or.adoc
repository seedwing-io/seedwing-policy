Parameterized pattern that the input value satisifies at least one member of the list parameters.
If the parameter is a list of patterns, each pattern will be individually checked.
If the parameter is *not* a list of patterns, the parameter is first evaluated, and if the result is a list of patterns, then the process proceeds as above.
