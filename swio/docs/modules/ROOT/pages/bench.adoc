== `bench`

The `bench` command allows for benchmarking the evaluation of an input against the policy and data directories and named policy provided.

The benchmarking tool will perform a warmup sequence 1/10th of the `count` iterations configured, before running the policy evaluation `count` times.

When done it prints a JSON output with statistics from the benchmark.

=== Usage

==== Input document `-i <FILE>`

Input can be provided via `STDIN` or using the `-i <FILE>` argument.

==== Pattern name: `-n <PATTERN>`

The pattern to benchmark the input document against must be specified using the `-n <PATTERN>` argument.

==== Count: `-c <COUNT>`

The number of iterations the benchmark should be repeated to get a statistically significant result.
