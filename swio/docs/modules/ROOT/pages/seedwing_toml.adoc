Any path specified will be resolved relative to the configuration file itself.

dirs = [
  "path/to/data/",
  "another/path/to/data/",
]
```

=== Data directories: `dirs = [ ... ]`

The `dirs` key may specify an array of directories to be loaded as data sources.
Any path specified will be resolved relative to the configuration file itself.

== `[config]` section

Within the `[config]` section, arbitrary key/value pairs are allowed.
These values are made available during evaluation of patterns using `config::of<KEY>`.

```toml
