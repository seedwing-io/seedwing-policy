= `test`

The `test` command runs a set of inputs against policies to test that their output is as expected.

== Usage

=== Input test directory: `-t <DIR>`

The `-t <DIR>` argument specifies the a directory containing input and expected output documents.

The directory structure should contain a subdirectory matching the path to the pattern under consideration.
Within the pattern directory, each directory specifies a named test.
Within each named test directory, at least `input.json` is required, specifying the input to consider.

Specifying the output is done using an `output` file with an appropriate extension and optional content:

* `output.identity`: The input value is expected to be unchanged as a satisfying output value.
* `output.json`: A specific transformed output value is expected and contained within this file.
* `output.any`: Any output is considered passing.
* `output.none`: The input is expected to *not* satisfy the pattern.
* If no output file is present, the test is considered *pending* and will neither pass nor fail.

Additionally, an `ignored` file may exist, in which case all other files are ignored and the test is skipped, neither passing nor failing, as with the pending case above.

For instance:

```
  policy-tests/
    base64/
      base64/              # tests base64::base64
        valid-document/    # named test of "valid-document"
          input.json       # the input value
          output.json      # the expected output value
        validish-document/ # named test of "valid-document"
          input.json       # the input value
          output.any       # an output value is expected, but no assertions about its content.
        invalid-document/  # named test of "invalid-document"
          input.json       # the input value
          output.none      # no output, expects the input to not satisfy the pattern
```

==== Test harness: `test.dog`

Any given named test directory may include an option `test.dog` file, which must include at least a single pattern named `test`, which will actually be used to perform the test, instead of the primary pattern designated through the directory structure.

It is assumed (but not required) that the two are somehow related.

A test harness is generally useful for testing _parameterized patterns_ which are otherwise not usually directly invokable.

This argument may be specified repeatedly to accumulate multiple test directories.

==== Configuration: `config.json` or `config.toml`

Configuration values available through `config::of<KEY>` are settable per-test, through the precense of a `config.json` file.

These values take precedent over any `[config]` section values from a xref::seedwing_toml.adoc[`Seedwing.toml`] that is in effect.

=== Pattern matching: `-m <MATCH>`

The `-m <MATCH>` argument may be used to specify a subset of tests to execute.

The `MATCH` argument prefix-matches against the name of the pattern under consideration joined with the named test.
There is no requirement that the `MATCH` argument be a complete name of a module, pattern or test.
Simple string-prefix matching occurs.

This argument may only be specified once.

For instance:

* `-m base64`: would match all tests for all patterns in the `base64` module.
* `-m base64::base64`: would match all tests for the `base64::base64` pattern.
* `-m base64::base64::valid-document`: would match exactly the `valid-document` test for `base64::base64`.
