= HACBS

Policies that apply the HACBS Enterprise Contract.

The HACBS attestations are built by tekton pipelines, and this example provides a few patterns to check build attestations using Dogma.

For instance, to ensure that a set of pipeline steps have been performed, the build info is put into an attestation, and the Seedwing policies can verify the envelope as well as the provenance information.

With the following policies:

[source,json]
----
include::example$hacbs.dog[]
----

and this attestation:

[source,json]
----
include::example$attestation.json[]
----

You can apply this policy using `swio`:

[source,bash]
----
swio eval -p examples -n hacbs::valid-attestation -i examples/attestation.json
----
