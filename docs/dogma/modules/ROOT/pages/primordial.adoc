== Primordial Patterns & Values

At the core of every pattern ultimately lies _primordials_.
They can be viewed as the foundational atoms from which all else grows.

The primordial patterns are:

* boolean
* string
* integer
* decimal

=== The `boolean` pattern 

The `boolean` primordial matches any boolean value; either `true` or `false`.

NOTE: This is dependent on the input value serialization method used. In YAML, the string `no` can occasionally be interpreted as `false`.

This pattern denotes that a field must contain a boolean value:

```
pattern dog = {
  trained: boolean
}
```

In addition to specifying the general `boolean` pattern, the values of `true` and `false` may also be used, to restrict acceptable inputs to exactly match `true` or `false`.

```
pattern trained-dog = {
  trained: true
}
```

=== The `string` pattern

The `string` primordial pattern matches any string as input.

For instance, this pattern `named` will match any string:

```
pattern named = string
```

Any actual string value in a pattern represents a string that _exactly_ matches the string.

For example, this pattern `named-bob` will only match the string `"bob"`:

```
pattern named-bob = "bob"
```

=== The `integer` pattern 

The `integer` primordial matches any integral value, signed or unsigned.

```
pattern numeric = integer
```

A specific integer value may be used to match _exactly_ that specific value.

```
pattern old-enough-to-retire = 65
```

=== The `decimal` pattern

The `decimal` primordial matches any number that involves a decimal component.

```
pattern weight-of-dog = decimal
```

As with the other primordials, decimal _values_ can be used to denote a requirement on that particular value.

```
pattern heavy-dog = 80.2
```
