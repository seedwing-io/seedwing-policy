= CycloneDX

== Checking that a payload is a valid CycloneDX document

You can use the existing pattern `cyclonedx::v1_4::bom` for that:

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d @bom.json \
  http://localhost:8080/policy/cyclonedx/v1_4/
----
== Check that there are no security vulnerabilities in your SBOM

Given an example SBOM like this:

[source,json]
----
include::example$cyclonedx/bom.json[]
----

You can construct a pattern that checks all package URLs in this SBOM for vulnerabilities:

[source]
----
include::example$cyclonedx/vuln.dog[]
----

You can validate this SBOM against Seedwing using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d @bom.json \
  http://localhost:8080/policy/vuln/not-affected
----
