A functional type system for implementing policy inspection, audit and enforcement.

Seedwing Policy consists of several components that may be combined or used standalone as part of a secure software supply chain:

* *Dogma* - a policy description language.
* *Engine* - a policy evaluation engine.
* *Server* - an HTTP server and API for evaluating policies.

With Seedwing Policy, you can:

* Validate, destructure and inspect payload according to standards like CycloneDX, SPDX, OpenVEX, PEM and more.
* Check for permitted licenses according to organization policy.
* Check for trusted signatures against [Sigstore](https://sigstore.dev).
* Check SBOM dependencies for vulnerabilities against [OSV](https://osv.dev).

All the policies can be centrally managed in a server, or built in as part of a custom application.

See the [documentation](https://docs.seedwing.io/docs/index.html) for more information.

### Other use cases

Seedwing Policy is primarily concerned with software supply chain, but may be used in other contexts as well such as authorization policies for Apache Kafka.

## Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV)

Seedwing Policy is guaranteed to compile on the latest stable Rust version at the time of release. It might compile with older versions.
