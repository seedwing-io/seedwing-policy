== Checking that a payload is a valid CycloneDX document

You can use the existing pattern `cyclonedx::v1_4::bom` for that:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-type: application/json" -d @bom.json http://localhost:8080/policy/cyclonedx/v1_4/
```
== Check that there are no security vulnerabilities for components

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-type: application/json" -d @bom.json http://localhost:8080/policy/vuln/
```
